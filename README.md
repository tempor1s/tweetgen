## [Deployed Version](https://tweetgen123.herokuapp.com/)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation and Requirements

Requirements:

[Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
[Pipenv](https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/)
[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)

We are going to assume you have Postgres installed and running. If not, please refer to the Postgres [documentation.](https://www.postgresql.org/)

Installation:

```bash
# clone the respository
git clone https://github.com/tempor1s/tweetgen
# cd into the project
cd tweetgen
# create a virtual environment and install the required packages
pipenv shell
pipenv install
```

Congrats! You should now have a locally installed version of tweetgen!

### Running The Project Locally

If you have not yet followed the installation steps, go and do so before continuing.

Once you have everything installed, you need to rename `.env.example` to `.env` and populate the fields with real data.

```bash
# rename .env.example to .env
mv .env.example .env
# populate the .env file with correct data using your favorite text editor!
vim .env
```

Once you have renamed the `.env` file and populated it with the correct data, all you need to do is run the server!

```bash
# run the server (make sure you are in your virtual environment you created in an earlier step)
python3 app.py
# navigate to localhost to see your running application!
http://localhost:5000
```

Congrats! You now have a local version of Tweet Generator running!
