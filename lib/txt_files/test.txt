Areas of Interest
When thinking about my areas of interest in software I keep coming back to three main things. Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and Brain-Machine interfaces. As the word advances, I feel that we are going to be come more and more intertwined with our technology than we already are, and these technologies are the highway to that future.
I first took a look at Virtual Reality. VR has many potential uses such as treatment of PTSD, or exploring vast virtual worlds. The issue that I see with it currently is that it is very stationary, which currently limits its uses until the technology itself gets better.
I then took a look at Brain-Machine interfaces such as Neuralink. I think this technology has the most potential overall as it will allow us to interface with Augmented Reality. This will allow things that we thought previously impossible, such as allowing paralyzed people to control phones / computers, too rapid advancement in technology. Currently, the only problem is that this technology is still in a very early stage and not at a point that it can easily be utilized.
Lastly I took a look at Augmented Reality, or AR. AR is being quickly developed and the technology is improving for it daily. I think AR currently has the most use-cases and potential as it is essentially just an extension to human capabilities. From on-boarding new hires at a company faster, too incredible experiences the entertainment industry can create, I think that Augmented Reality will have a profound impact on numerous industries. These reasons are what led me to pick Augmented Reality as the domain that I wanted to focus on to design my product.

Pest Analysis
Political — The way that I will use Augmented Reality will help people from all ages go outside and explore which is something that is becoming more rare in this day and age.
Economic — It is a great economic time for something like this to be created. All you need is a smart phone, which a large majority of people in the modern world have. This could also draw business to unknown locations since people are motivated to get out and explore new places.
Social — People are becoming less social with the invention of smart phones and applications that are meant you keep you hooked. My app would let people get out, explore, and meet new people that they may have otherwise not.
Technological — It is the perfect time for an app like this to be created. The technology is reaching the point where an application like this could run on just your smartphone. In the future when technology advances this could be created into an application for a AR headset / glasses that would improve it greatly. Also, google just added the ability to use AR walking directions in their Maps app that would be a great building block.
Competitive Landscape
Currently there are no other applications doing what I propose. There are applications in the tourism industry from hotels that allow you to explore their hotel rooms, but nothing that is city / town wide. Google has the possibility to do something like this with their recent addition of ‘Live View’ which allows you to get walking directions using your phone and AR. But Live View is only currently used for directions from point A to point B, whereas I want to create an app that allows you to just explore your city and meet new people who are doing the same thing.

Competitive Landscape
User Interviews
User interviews are one of the most import aspects of product design and picking a domain that you want to build your project for. They allow you to gain valuable real world information about pain points that someone has, or to get mostly unbiased feedback to if a product you are creating actually has a need in the real world. If you have multiple ideas, they allow you can gain valuable knowledge on the path that you should take.

To conduct a successful interview, one of the most important things is to ask unbiased questions to your interviewee. If you ask biased questions, you will get skewed data towards the answer that you are secretly looking for. This lead me to trying to come up with unbiased questions that would allow me to get information about my product. The thing I forgot to mention were the questions that come before asking the more serious questions. These can be things such as “How has your day been?”, or anything that can make the person you are interviewing more comfortable. You are a stranger who walked up to them after all! After that you need to ask qualifying questions. These can be things like, “Do you have a smartphone?”. This would be a question that would be great if your app is smartphone only! Otherwise, the answers that they give will be experiences from friends, or they may just make stuff up! Below I show the general way that I conducted my user interviews.
Questions
Thanks for taking the time out of your day to answer a few questions.
Hows your day been?
Do you have a smartphone? — Disqualifying question because the tech won’t work without one currently
How do you find new things to do on your off-day?
Do you every do touristy things, like take a tour bus or do a walkabout?
Would you like to get out more and discover more of the city? If so, Tell me how you find new cool places in the city that you live in.
Once you have asked more general open-ended questions, you can get more into a deep dive. These questions are very difficult to script due to the nature of them, with them having to be based off of the information that you are getting from the person you are interviewing. These can be very helpful for getting more specific data that can be used for the design of your application.
Interviews
Now that I have explained how to do a user interview and given you the questions that I asked people, I can tell you about what I learned.
Question 1 — Every single person that I interviewed had a smart phone, so everyone who I talked to was qualified to give me information.
Question 2 — Here I asked what people do on their off day. One person said that they get information from their parents because they live in the area and give good recommendations. Someone else said that they primarily use google and general internet posts. I dove a bit deeper here, and they said that if they had some sense of direction they would explore more.
Question 3 — The general consensus was that people like to do tourist things whenever they travel, but don’t get out as much as they would like when they are in their home location. I dove a bit deeper here, and people said that they are generally more into their work / life and not focused on seeing new things, compared to when they are traveling and that is all they are looking to do.
Question 4 — Most people said yes, they would like to get out and explore more, but generally don’t have the motivation too in their home city.
Product Design
So, you may be thinking now, what is your idea! Funny thing about that is that it has completely changed since I started writing this article. The project that I am undertaking now has nothing to do with Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality or Brain-Human interfaces. The product I am working on is called Juiced. Juiced helps owners of personal electric vehicles (Onewheel, Boosted Board, etc) gain an accurate prediction as to how much battery they will have at the end of a trip by using rider weight and trip elevation gain / descent. Nothing on the market currently exists that will give you an accurate prediction, only a guess. This app would increase the use of personal electric vehicles worldwide and remove the range anxiety that a lot of people have, including myself!
User Journeys

User Journeys are incredibly useful understanding multiple aspects of how you want to build out your application. One of these uses is only building out features that are actually going to be used by a user, compared to features that you as a developer would think are cool. The user story that I developed for my application is as followed.
“I’m a Onewheel rider and I am looking for an application that allows me get a real battery reading for my device. I search the app store and find Juiced and I download it. I create an account, put in my weight and current battery percentage on the starter screen and then put in the destination that I want to go. I click calculate and it gives me the battery that I will have left and then asks if I want to open the maps application on my phone to get directions to where I am going.”
The reason that I made this user journey was to make sure that I don’t add any features that would be unnecessary. It shows the core features, and what needs to be built out for the app to function, where as any bells and whistles can come later. I found that I would need to integrate maps somehow to make it so that the user does not need to put in their location in a maps program first.
Wireframe
When it came time to starting building my application, I had no idea where to start or what the application would even look like. Then I learned of wireframes, and how they allow you to rapidly prototype the design of an application on paper and get an idea of what you want the layout to be.

Basic wireframe of my application
Above is a basic wireframe of the basic application that I would build out. It has all the features needed from the user story, and gives me an idea of what I can build out as a first prototype. From here I want to add additional features that could include cool crowd-shared routes from the users of Juiced and a way to get new recommended routes that would consume less battery compared to the one recommended by google maps.

I am now currently working Juiced as a side project, and hope to have a MVP working by the end of the year. Thanks for reading my amazing blog post
